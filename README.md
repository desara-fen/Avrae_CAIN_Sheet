# Avrae_CAIN_Sheet

So this is a little project I am doing for people who play Tom Bloom's CAIN using Avrae. It makes use of Avrae's capability to import sheets from Google Sheets to create a sort-of "character sheet," but with information appropriate for CAIN.

I am not a good coder by any means, and this may be a little janky. But! For the sake of convenience, it's what I'm doing. 

Please read the help texts <3 

Thanks!
