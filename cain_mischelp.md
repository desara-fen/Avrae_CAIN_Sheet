A character sheet alias for [Tom Bloom's CAIN](<https://tombloom.itch.io/cain/>).

> **Note**: Before running this alias, you need to `!import` a character through Avrae since it will attach the information to that particular character. For this, you can make a copy of this [modified gsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gMU3bz5iyONDCOcNyYuYLpztb_8RdL6GaI50PhUkTq0/edit?usp=sharing) that has both the typical Avrae Gsheet information (v1.14) and a few tabs for your CAIN character taken from <@465192139987615765>'s [v1 CAIN Character Gsheet](https://discord.com/channels/426286410496999425/1277789952817627136/1277789952817627136). The necessary fields for the sheet to be valid in Avrae have already been filled out.
